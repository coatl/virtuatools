This is a collection of little scripts I have found useful when working 
with vmware virtual machines.

vmstart.sh  -  start up a vm from the command line, and prevent its 
               window from having an ugly name
copy-vm.sh  -  copy (or rename) an existing vm
vcp         -  copy a file to or from a running vm. 
               requires agent running in the vm
vsh         -  connect to a serial console in a running vm. 
               requires getty running on serial port in the vm
vm-hd-mv.sh -  move a virtual hard drive from one vm to another
